django-simple-forum
===================

A very simple/minimalistic Django Forum

The goal is to provide a very simple/minimalistic starter app
for those seeking to add forum capabilities to their web application.
Most of the code & ideas were taken from here:

http://lightbird.net/dbe/forum1.html

So a lot of thanks goes to the guy/girl who took the time to put
the tutorial together.

Installation
===================

Clone this repository and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS list then run:

./manage.py migrate django_simple_forums 

to get the database schema setup.
